===============

The Forgotten Server is a free and open-source MMORPG server emulator written in C++. It is a fork of the [OpenTibia Server](https://github.com/opentibia/server) project. To connect to the server, you can use [OTClient](https://github.com/edubart/otclient) or [OpenTibiaUnity](https://github.com/slavidodo/OpenTibia-Unity).

### Getting Started

* [Compiling](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver/wiki/Compiling), alternatively download [AppVeyor builds for Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/otland/forgottenserver)
* [Scripting Reference](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver/wiki/Script-Interface)

### What is this?
Use *this branch* in conjuction with [this client front-end](https://github.com/Leo32onGIT/forgottenserver-flash-accmaker) for proof-of-concept in using the flash client.

I have created a [branch to use as a testing environment](https://github.com/Leo32onGIT/forgottenserver/tree/10.79-test-env), which I think is where it has value.
